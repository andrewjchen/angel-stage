Currently, the project contains both SDL and Allegro.

Pros of SDL:
  Lower draw time using SDL_HWSURFACE (1/3 of Allegro's).
  More commonly used.
  Also the source of our original networking code.
  Some advanced features (videos).
  More bindings?

Cons of SDL:
  Inconsistent interface, strange use of SDL_Rect.
  Longer blit time (50 times Allegro's).
  Doesn't respect VSync, even when ordered to.


Pros of Allegro:
  Does use VSync correctly, possible source of slow draw time.
  More consistent interface.
  Faster blit time (1/50 of SDL's).
  More functions (ex: rotate).
  iOS support.

Cons of Allegro:
  Also inconsistent interface.
  Slower draw time (3 times SDL's).
